// The identity key is answered by a decision procedure, so it is pinned by a
// table rather than by cases. Rows are the shapes a session or an invocation can
// legally take, columns the ways a context is derived from one. Reviewing this
// procedure a diff at a time found one failing shape per round over five rounds,
// each fix moving the failure to a neighbouring shape.
//
// The policy the table encodes:
//   - An invocation reports the user of its OWN session, never one it inherited.
//   - An invocation with no session of its own delegates, which is what a tool or
//     callback context needs — theirs is nil by design.
//   - An invocation that cannot answer at all reports nothing. Broken is not
//     absent, and delegating would hand back a different call's user.
//   - No shape panics out of Value, and no shape disturbs an unrelated key.
