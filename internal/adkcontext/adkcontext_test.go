// Package adkcontext_test is an external test package on purpose: for method
// sets it behaves exactly as any package outside this module does, which is the

// [adkcontext.Source] with an unexported method of its own and would prove
// nothing.

// TestSourceMethodIsUnexported guards the property the whole mechanism rests on.
//
// Go satisfies interfaces structurally, and an unexported method name is
// qualified by its declaring package while an exported one is not. So
// [adkcontext.Source] excludes outside types only while its single method stays
// unexported. Rename it and any type anywhere satisfies Source without importing
// this package — and agent's identity procedure ASKS a Source for the invocation
// it speaks for, rather than reading its session, which is the one arm that
// extends real trust.
//
// Nothing else checks this. The rename was tried and the entire suite stayed
// green, and the doc on the internal package invites reading the internal/
// directory as sufficient on its own, which it is not: internal/ governs who may
// import, never who may satisfy.

// declared here: a context key compares by dynamic type as well as value, so an
// untyped `const IdentityKey = 0`, or an exported `CtxKey`, would let any package
// forge an identity with context.WithValue(ctx, 0, agent.Identity{...}) and have
// the credential path mint for it.

// succeeds and the entire suite stays green. That is the same shape as the
